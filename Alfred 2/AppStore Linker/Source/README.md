## Introduction
App Store Linker is a simple workflow that allows you to search the MAS and iOS App Store for apps. Actioning an item will return as a result:

1. Your Affiliate Link to the App formatted as a markdown link;
2. Your Affiliate Link to the App, as a plain link;
3. Simple Link to the App with markdown formatting;
4. Simple Link to the App without markdown formatting;


## Installation and Requisites
1. Download the Workflow from [here](http://cl.ly/1z0P1T2x460E) and double click to import.
Once you've imported the workflow be sure to change your affiliate link ([here's](http://cl.ly/0M291e3m2a1d) a quick example of how to do it).

## Features
The workflow pulls from the App Store the apps icon, name and developer (visible in the subtext). After choosing the desired result hitting enter will copy a markdown formatted link ([App Name](Affiliate Link)).
Hitting alt+enter will copy just the affiliate link.

## Usage
Summon Alfred and type **li [arg] App Name**

**arg:**  

- **-i** -- iPad Software;
- **-s** -- iOS Sotware;
- **-m** -- Mac Software

**arg** is optional and defaults to macSoftware

## Limitations
There workflow is still a little raw and slow (thanks to app store search) but I will be working on improving this in the coming versions.

## Update
A small but useful update to the workflow (at least for me) is the ability to see the apps price. If you have the app installed, there is no real easy way of seeing how much it costs. That is without copying the link and opening it up in your browser of choice.

Now just skim the subtitle and you'll see the apps price.
