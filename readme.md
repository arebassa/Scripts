# Collection of Assorted little Scripts

A simple collection of scripts, either in AppleScript or shell to simplify and enhance my productivity. They are to be used in conjunction with other apps, namely [Alfred App][1], [Geektool][2] and [TaskPaper][3]

## Alfred App
You need the [Power Pack][4] in order to take advantage of these scripts.

- **Network Actions**  
	The reasoning behind this was the fact that I work a lot from home and therefore I need to toggle the VPN on/off and know it's state quite frequently. I don't like the extra clutter of having that info on the menubar so enter Alfred and Growl.
- **TaskPaper Timetracking**
	A simple script to aid in tracking time spent on tasks in TaskPaper. Time is tracked in conjunction with [TicToc][5] and a *Special* tag qith the value of the task in TicToc.


## Geektool Script
You need the Mac App Store version of [Geektool][2] installed for these to work.

- **VolumeBar Indicator**  
	Some sexy eyecandy that display the curren tvolume level on the desktop clearing up the menubar of the volume icon
- **Stitched Menubar**  
	Just some more eyecandy that overlays a stitched pattern over the menubar and a script to toggle it on/off based on full screen apps running so it isn't in the way whil say, watching a movie.

## TaskPaper
- **Timetracking**  
	The same script as above but without the *personalization* for [Alfred][1]
