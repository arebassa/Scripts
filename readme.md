# Collection of Assorted little Scripts

A simple collection of scripts, either in AppleScript or shell to simplify and enhance my productivity. They are to be used in conjunction with other apps, namely [Alfred App][1], [Geektool][2] and [TaskPaper][3]

## Alfred 2
- **App Store Linker**  
	A simple workflow to search for an app and return an affiliate link
	_Needs to be updated to work with new affiliate link format._

- **Spotlight Comments**  
	A workflow to add spotlight comments to the selected file in finder.
- **Mail Actions**
	A workflow to navigate Mailboxes,move and copy selected emails with Alfred.
- **Royal TSX Quick Connect**  
	A workflow to quickly connect to Royal TSX clients with history.

## TaskPaper
- **Timetracking**  
	The same script as above but without the *personalisation* for [Alfred][1]
- **Extended Notes**  
	The same script as above but without the *personalisation* for [Alfred][1]

## Geektool Script
You need the Mac App Store version of [Geektool][2] installed for these to work.

- **VolumeBar Indicator**  
	Some sexy eyecandy that display the curren tvolume level on the desktop clearing up the menubar of the volume icon
- **Stitched Menubar**  
	Just some more eyecandy that overlays a stitched pattern over the menubar and a script to toggle it on/off based on full screen apps running so it isn't in the way whil say, watching a movie.

## Archive
I've moved old scripts and code to Archive. Hopefully this should minimise the clutter. 

- **SimpleTasks**  
	A simple tasklist fot OpenBox pipe menu and Conky.   
	*Note: I haven't tested this in ages and cannot vouch it will still work*

### Alfred App
You need the [Power Pack][4] in order to take advantage of these scripts.

- **Network Actions**  
	The reasoning behind this was the fact that I work a lot from home and therefore I need to toggle the VPN on/off and know it's state quite frequently. I don't like the extra clutter of having that info on the menubar so enter Alfred and Growl.
- **TaskPaper Timetracking**  
	A simple script to aid in tracking time spent on tasks in TaskPaper. Time is tracked in conjunction with [TicToc][5] and a *Special* tag qith the value of the task in TicToc.
- **TaskPaper Extended Notes**  
	A simple script that allows you to open a note/document based on a specific tag. You can define as many note/document types and which application they open in (rather than rely on default).
- **Scratch File**  
	A simple extension to append text to a file (beginning or end) with Alfred.  
- **Alfred-Tagger**  
    A simple extension and automator worklfow to aid in tagging 1 or multiple files with 
- **Create New File**  
	A simple extension to create a new file either in the current folder (frontmost finder window) or default location if no finder window is open.
