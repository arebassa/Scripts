## Introduction

[Alfred][] is a great productivity app for Mac OS X which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web. By itself it's a great application but with the [Powerpack][]
the possibilities seem endless.


## Extension Description
Iâ€™ve been looking of ways in which Hazel could help speed up some of my workflows and decided I would create a few rules to archive files based on Spotlight comments. I quickly realised that adding those comments was a tedious chore, one better left to Alfred. So enter 
**Alfred Spotlight Comments** (catchy name ... huh)

## Installation and Setup
As with all extension, installing is simply a matter of downloading the extension
