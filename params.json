They are to be used in conjunction with other apps, namely [Alfred App][1], [Geektool][2] and [TaskPaper][3]\r\n\r\n## Alfred App\r\nYou need the [Power Pack][4] in order to take advantage of these scripts.\r\n\r\n- **Network Actions**  \r\n\tThe reasoning behind this was the fact that I work a lot from home and therefore I need to toggle the VPN on/off and know it's state quite frequently. I don't like the extra clutter of having that info on the menubar so enter Alfred and Growl.\r\n- **TaskPaper Timetracking**  \r\n\tA simple script to aid in tracking time spent on tasks in TaskPaper. Time is tracked in conjunction with [TicToc][5] and a *Special* tag qith the value of the task in TicToc.\r\n- **TaskPaper Extended Notes**  \r\n\tA simple script that allows you to open a note/document based on a specific tag. You can define as many note/document types and which application they open in (rather than rely on default).\r\n- **Scratch File**  \r\n\tA simple extension to append text to a file (beginning or end) with Alfred.  \r\n- **Alfred-Tagger**  \r\n    A simple extension and automator worklfow to aid in tagging 1 or multiple files with \r\n- **Create New File**  \r\n\tA simple extension to create a new file either in the current folder (frontmost finder window) or default location if no finder window is open.\r\n\r\n## Geektool Script\r\nYou need the Mac App Store version of [Geektool][2] installed for these to work.\r\n\r\n- **VolumeBar Indicator**  \r\n\tSome sexy eyecandy that display the curren tvolume level on the desktop clearing up the menubar of the volume icon\r\n- **Stitched Menubar**  \r\n\tJust some more eyecandy that overlays a stitched pattern over the menubar and a script to toggle it on/off based on full screen apps running so it isn't in the way whil say, watching a movie.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\nThese are just a few small script I found lying around (on BitBucket too) and decided to share them here, just to keep things coherent. They are one-off scripts that are not really developed.  \r\n- **SimpleTasks**  \r\nA simple tasklist fot OpenBox pipe menu and Conky.   \r\n*Note: I haven't tested this in ages and cannot vouch it will still work*\r\n\r\n- **GeditDjangoTools**  \r\nA collection of external tools for Gedit to aid Django development.  \r\n*Note: I haven't tested this in ages and cannot vouch it will still work*\r\n\r\n## TaskPaper\r\n- **Timetracking**  \r\n\tThe same script as above but without the *personalization* for [Alfred][1]\r\n- **Extended Notes**  \r\n\tThe same script as above but without the *personalization* for [Alfred][1]\r\n\r\n[1]:http://www.alfredapp.com\r\n[2]:http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/\r\n[3]:http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper/\r\n[4]:http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/\r\n[5]:http://overcommitted.com/tictoc/","tagline":"A set of personal Scripts","name":"Scripts","google":""}
